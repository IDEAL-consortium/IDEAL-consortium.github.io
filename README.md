# Impact Data and Evidence Aggregation Library (IDEAL)

Hello and welcome to IDEAL, a platform designed to extract results data from international development RCTs and make them accessible to researchers and policymakers. The project is currently in a pilot phase, during which we extract information from a curated initial set of studies and develop robust protocols to grow and maintain IDEAL in the future.

IDEAL is supported by a global consortium of institutions. Hosted by the World Bank, IDEAL will be fully open-access and free for the world to use. Users will be able to easily search, compare, and visualize the relative effect sizes of different policy interventions on a range of outcomes, across countries and contexts. IDEAL will facilitate quantitative meta-analyses as well as qualitative reviews, whether centered on a policy, population, or outcome.

You can view the IDEAL metadata schema to see what data is collected and the detailed coding protocol for the IDEAL survey, with guidance for our coders who are completing the data extraction. Data extraction for IDEAL is currently done using a survey mask developed using Open Data Kit (ODK), maintained by SurveyCTO. We have also developed a custom-built dashboard for internal tracking and GitHub tools to communicate with coders. To request a demo of the data entry mask, please contact us.
